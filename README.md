# SimpsonsParadox: Automatic Simpson's Paradox Detector

## Description
This function will automatically detect Simpsonâ€™s pairs (i.e. pairs of independent and conditioning variables) in a dataset with a pre-defined DV using regression models.

This function will also do pre-processing steps prior to checking the dataset: 
1. Excluding user-defined variables from the analysis 
2. Encoding any non-numeric variables in the data set 
3. Standardizing any continuous variables in the data
4. Binning large conditioning variables in the data

This function can output the following:
1. The pair of variables with Simpson's Paradox (i.e. independent and conditioning independent variables)
2. Some of the summary statistics from the model generated for the aggregated data and disaggregated data
3. A simple plot of the regression lines for the aggregated and each subgroup of the disaggregated data

More details about the preprocessing steps, possible outputs, and terminology can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/ehart-altair/SimpsonsParadox/wiki).

## Usage: Jupyter 
1.	Download and unzip ``SimpsonsParadox-master.zip`` or use Git Bash to clone the repo.
2.	Open Anaconda Prompt, navigate to the directory of this project, and run the following commands:
* `conda env create -f environment.yml`
* `conda activate simpsons-paradox`
* `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook`
3. Modify the given notebook to run an example as follows:
```python
kwargs = {
    'df': df, # The pandas dataframe with the desired data set
    'dv': 'class', # The dependent variable to run analysis for
    'ignore_columns': ['user_id'], # A list of columns to ignore
    'bin_columns': ['timestamp'], # A list of the columns to bin
}

simpsons_pairs = SimpsonsParadox(**kwargs).get_simpsons_pairs()
```
This will output a list of Simpson's pairs to the ```simpsons_pairs``` object, and display a series of plots and summary statistics tables for each pair if ```output_plots=True```.

It's possible to modify other parameters (with smart defaults outlined in this [Wiki](https://github.com/ehart-altair/SimpsonsParadox/wiki/Arguments)). Some of these parameters are:
```python
self.model = 'logistic'
self.output_plots = True # Displays plots and summary statistics
self.weighting = True # Excludes weak cases of Simpson's Paradox
self.max_pvalue = 0.05 # Filters out pairs with large p-values
self.min_corr = 0.01 # Filters out pairs with no correlation
self.quiet = True # Silences all warnings and verbosity
```

In some cases, the function will run into issues if the appropriate arguments aren't passed. For example, if you pass these arguments on this example data:
```python
## Example 8: COVID-19 Data
kwargs = {
    "df": pd.read_csv('data/conposcovidloc.csv'),
    "dv": 'Outcome1',
    "ignore_columns": ['Row_ID'],
    "output_plots": True
}

simpsons_pairs = SimpsonsParadox(**kwargs).get_simpsons_pairs()

```
You'll get the following error:
```
ValueError: You have a non-binary DV. Pass a value to the target_category in the function or re-bin your DV prior to using the function.
```
To fix this issue, add an additional argument to set a target category for one-versus-all logistic regression as follows:
```python 
kwargs = {
    "df": pd.read_csv('data/conposcovidloc.csv'),
    "dv": 'Outcome1',
    "ignore_columns": ['Row_ID'],
    "output_plots": True,
    "target_category": 1
}
```
Now the function should be able to run successfully.

## Usage: Scripts 
You can also call this function from the command line.

1.	Download and unzip ``SimpsonsParadox-master.zip`` or clone the repo
2.	Open a command line and navigate to the directory of this project
3.  See the [Wiki](https://github.com/ehart-altair/SimpsonsParadox/wiki) for example commands.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/ehart-altair/SimpsonsParadox/wiki) for more details about the arguments.
